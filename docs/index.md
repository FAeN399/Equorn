## Welcome to Equorn

Equorn is an **open‑source generative myth‑engine** that turns structured narrative blueprints into runnable game modules, interactive art pieces, or lore documents with a single command. It bridges the gap between narrative design and playable prototype so world‑builders can iterate at mythic scale without wrestling low‑level boilerplate.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Myth Seeds**: Define your world in simple YAML or JSON
- **Multi-Target Export**: Generate for Godot, Unity, web, or documentation sites
- **Rapid Prototyping**: From concept to playable prototype in minutes
- **Extensible Templates**: Use our templates or create your own
- **Modern Web Dashboard**: Visualize and refine your myths in real-time

## Getting Started

If you're new to Equorn, we recommend starting with the [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) guide, followed by the [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md) tutorial.

## Example

Here's a simple example of what you can do with Equorn:

```bash
# Install Equorn
$ pnpm install

# Seed a new project
$ pnpm equorn seed ./seeds/forest-guardian.yaml --target godot

# Launch the dashboard
$ pnpm dev
```

From this simple seed file, Equorn will generate a complete Godot project with scenes, characters, and interactivity based on your mythic blueprint.
