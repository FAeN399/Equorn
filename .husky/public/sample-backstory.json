  "freeText": "Long ago, the Crown of Stars bound the five realms together under a single banner of peace and prosperity. The crown channeled the ley lines that crisscrossed the world, maintaining harmony between magic and technology. But three centuries have passed since the crown was shattered in the Great Sundering, its fragments scattered to the winds. Now, as the old barriers weaken, ancient powers stir in forgotten ruins. Mechanical constructs powered by steam and clockwork patrol the cities, while in the wilderness, elemental spirits reclaim their lost territories. The Academy of Convergence, where scholars once studied the marriage of arcane and scientific principles, lies in ruins. Dark cults worship the Void that consumed the old capital, and political tensions rise as five successor kingdoms vie for dominance. Strange phenomena plague the land: clockwork automatons gaining sentience, mages whose spells malfunction catastrophically, and reports of creatures that seem to exist partially in another realm. Some say the scattered crown fragments are awakening, calling to those worthy of reuniting them. Others believe the Sundering was necessary, that the old ways led only to stagnation and tyranny. But all agree that change is coming, whether salvation or doom.",
