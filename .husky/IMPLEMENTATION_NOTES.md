## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This implementation follows computational narratology principles, treating stories as emergent systems rather than linear sequences. The multi-agent approach allows for collaborative narrative intelligence, while the storylet system provides modular, condition-based story building blocks.

The system balances:
- **Creative Freedom**: User-defined elements with AI enhancement
- **Technical Precision**: Type-safe, well-structured codebase  
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces for complex systems
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple inputs creating rich, dynamic narratives
