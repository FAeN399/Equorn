Looking at this action plan for Equorn, I see several areas that need adjustment based on the **actual project state**. Here's what I would change:

## 🚨 **Major Reordering Needed**

### **Current Plan Problem:**
The plan focuses on **infrastructure improvements** when the core functionality **doesn't exist yet**. It's like optimizing the CI/CD for a car factory when you haven't built an engine.

### **What I'd Change:**

## 🎯 **NEW Priority 1: Core Functionality (URGENT - 1-2 weeks)**

**1.1 (Critical: 1-2 days)**
- **Task:** Implement the actual `seed` command that's advertised in README
- **Current State:** CLI exists but `pnpm equorn seed` returns "command not found"
- **Goal:** Make the main feature actually work
- **Success:** `pnpm equorn seed forest-guardian.yaml --target godot` creates a working project

**1.2 (Critical: 3-5 days)**  
- **Task:** Create example seed files referenced in documentation
- **Current State:** README mentions `forest-guardian.yaml` but it doesn't exist
- **Goal:** Provide working examples users can test immediately

**1.3 (Critical: 1 week)**
- **Task:** Implement at least ONE target generator (recommend Godot)
- **Current State:** Generators are stubbed with TODO comments
- **Goal:** Complete end-to-end workflow from YAML → working project

## 📝 **Revised Documentation Priority (After Core Works)**

**Instead of generic CONTRIBUTING.md first, prioritize:**

**2.1 (Quick Win: 1-2 days)**
- **Task:** Create actual seed file documentation with working examples
- **Why Changed:** Users need to understand the core concept before contributing
- **Tools:** Real YAML examples that actually work with the system

**2.2 (Medium: 1 week)**  
- **Task:** Document the generation pipeline that actually exists
- **Why Changed:** No point documenting architecture that isn't implemented

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy Adjustment**

**Instead of coverage thresholds first:**

**3.1 (After core works: 1-2 days)**
- **Task:** Add integration tests for the seed → output pipeline
- **Why Changed:** Coverage is meaningless if the core functionality is broken
- **Success:** Tests verify YAML input produces expected project structure

## 🔄 **What I'd Remove/Defer:**

### **Remove from Quick Wins:**
- ❌ "hello world stubs" - the packages need real functionality, not more stubs
- ❌ Coverage thresholds - premature when core features don't work
- ❌ Docker CI builds - not useful until there's something to build

### **Defer to Long-term:**
- All the sophisticated CI/CD pipeline work
- Release management and semantic versioning
- Advanced architecture refactoring

## 🎯 **My Recommended Timeline:**

### **Week 1-2: Make It Work**
1. Implement working CLI `seed` command
2. Create example seed files
3. Build one complete generator (Godot)
4. Add basic error handling

### **Week 3-4: Make It Reliable**  
1. Add integration tests for core workflow
2. Improve error messages and validation
3. Create proper documentation for working features
4. Set up basic CI for real functionality

### **Month 2+: Make It Professional**
1. Add more generators (Unity, web, docs)
2. Implement sophisticated testing and coverage
3. Build release pipeline
4. Add contributor documentation

## 💡 **Bottom Line:**

The original plan is **premature optimization**. Equorn needs to **walk before it runs**. Focus on delivering the core promise first, then build professional development practices around working functionality.

**Key principle:** Don't optimize the development process for a product that doesn't deliver its main value proposition yet! 🚀
